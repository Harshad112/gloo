  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: >
      Validation of `TranslatorSyncerExtensions` is now enabled.
      The Validator interface has changed, we have deleted the `ModificationIsSupported`, and `DeletionIsSupported` methods, as they are
      no longer needed.  All supported resources are now mentioned in the gateway-validation-webhook-configuration.yaml.
      The `IgnoreProxyValidationFailure` flag was intended to ignore network issues between the Gateway server and the Gloo server.
      Since the Gateway server and the Gloo server have merged, this is no longer an issue that can occur, and the field is now deprecated.
