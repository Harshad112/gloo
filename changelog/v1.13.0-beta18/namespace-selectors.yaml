    description: |
      Added the ability to watch namespaces by setting the `watchNamespacesLabelSelectors` 
      in the settings API. `watchNamespaces` work as normally. When the selectors are set 
      Gloo will watch, in addition to the watched namespaces, namespaces that
      are labeled and meet the criteria of the label selectors. If `watchNamespaces` is not set
      then it will only watch namespaces set by the `watchNamespacesLabelSelectors`, if the selectors
      are set else all. Please look at [set based labels filtering](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#set-based-requirement)
      and [equity based label filtering](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#equality-based-requirement)
      both of which can be used to construct the selector filtering.
